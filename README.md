# Python List Operations

This simple Python script demonstrates common operations with lists, including adding, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding elements.

## ðŸ§  What the Script Does

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40`.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extends the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

```python
Index of 30: 3
